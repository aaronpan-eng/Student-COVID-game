# Student COVID game

# Description
In this game, the objective is to finish school as fast as possible. You are a student who has to go to classrooms to earn credits in order to finish school, but you have to avoid getting sick (COVID themed) to finish class as fast as possible.

NOTE: This game was made as a project in my Intro to Software Engineering course back in Dec 2021.
Transferred to my repo to showcase some C++ oriented projects

# Instructions
1) Have gcc installed
2) Use makefile and command "make" in the terminal to compile
3) Run Covid_game.exe to play
